# DSSS Homework 9: Chatbot Telegram

This project is a Telegram chatbot implementation.

## How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to run the project:

1. **Install Required Libraries**
   Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required libraries by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If any required libraries are not already installed on your system, this command will take care of installing them.

2. **Run the Main Script**
   After installing the necessary libraries, execute the main script using:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will start the chatbot.
